        EC DIGIT CSIRC will assist system administrators in handling the
        technical and organizational aspects of security incidents occurring at 
        the European Commission.
       
        EC DIGIT CSIRC requires an official security contact from each member of
        its constituency, typically the site security team.  In particular, it
        will provide assistance or advice with respect to the following aspects
        of incident management:


   5.1.1 Incident Triage

        - Analysing whether indeed an incident occurred.
        
        - Determining the extent of the incident.
  
   5.1.2 Incident Coordination


       - Analysing available information.

       - Contact the organisation affected.
    
       - Facilitating contact with other sites, which may be involved.
    
       - Support the organization affected with additional information related to the
         incident.


       - Performing specialized tasks, such as
         forensic analysis, malware reverse engineering etc. if requested.
        
   5.2 Proactive Activities

        The EC DIGIT CSIRC is proactively searching for anomalies on European
        Commission IT systems to reduce the detection time of IT security incidents (hunting).

  8. Security Considerations

      This document discusses the operation of Computer Security Incident
      Response Teams, and the teams' interactions with their constituencies
      and with other organizations.  It is, therefore, not directly
      concerned with the security of protocols, applications, or network
      systems themselves.  It is not even concerned with particular
      responses and reactions to security incidents, but only with the
      appropriate description of the responses provided by CSIRTs.

      Nonetheless, it is vital that the CSIRTs themselves operate securely,
      which means that they must establish secure communication channels
      with other teams, and with members of their constituency.  They must
      also secure their own systems and infrastructure, to protect the
      interests of their constituency and to maintain the confidentiality
      of the identity of victims and reporters of security incidents.
